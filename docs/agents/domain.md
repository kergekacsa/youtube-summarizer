# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout for this repo

Single-context. The expected files are:

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root — domain glossary and vocabulary
- `docs/adr/` at the repo root — Architectural Decision Records

Neither exists yet. **Do not create them upfront.** They are created lazily by `/grill-with-docs` as terms and decisions actually get resolved.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root (if it exists)
- `docs/adr/` — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
